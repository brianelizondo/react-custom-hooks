* Step Two: useFlip

*  which will hold the business logic for flipping any type of card
*  
*  useFlip doesnâ€™t need to take an argument, and similar to useState, it should return an array with two elements. 
*  The first element is the current flip state of the card, and the second element is a function that will toggle the flip state.
